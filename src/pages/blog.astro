    <p>This is where I will post about my journey learning Astro.</p>
    <p>
      Day 1. Trying to just rely on just documentations and crash course (mb
      some reddit/stack overflor). Main reason for doing this is bc as AI as
      been so promient within my workspace, I still want to ensure that i can
      maintain my learning capabilities and sharpen myself. Also, programming is
      the funnest part tons. So I want to challenge myself a bit.
