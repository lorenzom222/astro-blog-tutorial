## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

      Day 1. Trying to just rely on just documentations and crash course (mb
      some reddit/stack overflor). Main reason for doing this is bc as AI as
      been so promient within my workspace, I still want to ensure that i can
      maintain my learning capabilities and sharpen myself. Also, programming is
      the funnest part tons. So I want to challenge myself a bit.
